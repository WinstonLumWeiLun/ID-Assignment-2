Theme 3: Covid-19

This is a website that allows people to stay updated on the newest Covid-19 confirmed cases and news, as well as teach people how to prevent the virus from spreading.


--- Design Process ---
_____________

We chose Covid-19 as our project type to show how serious Covid-19 is. Many people do not care how dangerous it was after everyone took the booster. However, the number of cases of Covid-19 infection and deaths, continues to rise. As a result, our first aim is to inform people about the dangers of Covid-19 and what they can do to protect themselves.
