# Theme 3: Covid-19
The Main Goal of this website is to allow people to stay updated on the newest and latest Covid-19's news and confirmed-cases daily, as well as teaching people on how to prevent the virus from spreading.

_____________

## Design Process
We chose Covid-19 as our project theme to show how serious the Covid-19 is. Many people do not care about how about dangerous it was after everyone took the booster shot. However, the number of cases relating to the Covid-19's infections and deaths continues to rise. As a result, our first aim is to inform and show our users about the dangers and risks of the Covid-19 Virus and also together with the ways that they can do to protect themselves from this deadly virus. 

People can get the most up-to-date information on the confirmed cases around the world everyday, and they can compare cases from day one to now to see how quickly Covid-19 spreads and are affecting people.

They may know what symptoms they have if they suspect they've been infected, as well as what precautions to take and what steps to take right away to prevent the infection from spreading.
