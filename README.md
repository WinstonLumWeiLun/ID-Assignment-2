# Theme 3: Covid-19
To start off, my team have decided to design our website's overall color theme (including font colors) with multiple variations in colors such as white, red, gold and semi-black. This allows our website to be much more visually appealing instead of being plain and boring to our users, which aids us in attracting more users to visit our website. My team have also implemented custom styles to the scroll-bar on our website, so as to make it unique and fresh instead of using the provided default scroll-bar. From the "Home Page", it consists of the main title of the website, which is also the theme that we have chosen for this assignment project, "Covid-19". There is also a navigation menu which aids the users to navigate through our website with convenience. Not only that, but the navigation menu's display will also adapt to suit mobile users, making it an overall user-friendly websites for our users.The final highlights of the "Home" Page would be the typing back and forth animated text which loops continously to display the main topic of our website to our users.

Next, we have the "About" Page that gives a brief introduction to our users about the Covid-19 Virus. Below the introduction, there is a live program that displays the various data of confirmed cases regarding Covid-19 from all around the world. Users will be able to interact with it, such as choosing/filtering their desired choice of country and also the specific date to determine the amount of confirmed cases. The next page would be the "Symptoms" Page, which allows the users to know about the common symptoms of the Covid-19 Virus. This page involves the use of smooth sliding feature, which users can interact with to see the different common symptoms of the Covid-19 Virus. Moving on, we have the "Precautious" Page that displays the neccessary precautions steps to take against the Covid-19 Virus, such as showing the DO's and DONT's. In this page, when users hover over the contents, there will be a highlighted and scale up animation on it to give the users attention and an easier reading experience of the contents. Moving on, The next page would be the "Prevent" Page. As the name suggest, this page shows the most important and common preventive ways for our users to note in order to avoid Covid-19 from spreading to them. This page also uses the scale up animation when our users hover over the contents, so as to allow them to have an easier and better reading experience, just like the previous page "Precautious".

The last second page would be the "Contact" Page, which allows users to fill up a simple interactive contact form to get in touch with us quickly. As our users submit the contact form successfully, they will be able to determine whether their details have been send to us, just by checking below the contact form which displays the live database of the details entered from the contact form by our users. Lastly, the last page of our website would be the "Quiz" Page. The "Quiz" Page is created to give our users the opportunity to participate in a short multiple-choice-question that tests them on what they have learn from our website. After attempting the quiz, the page will display the respective points that they have scored to the users. After that, they will then be prompted to enter their name, whereby their respective score together with their name, would be recorded and saved in another page (access via the "High Scores" button). Users can view their respective high-scores and also other users' high-scores.

## Design Process
For our ID Assignment 2, we have decided to go with **"Covid-19"** as our Project Theme. The reason behind our decision, was due to the fact that Covid-19 have been a deadly virus consistently praying on our world for 2 years straight, and there is still no signs of it stopping yet. Many people in the world have began to not care about how dangerous the Covid-19 can be after taking the Booster Vaccination Shot. However, the number of cases relating to the Covid-19's infections and deaths continues to rise as of today's date. 

Therefore, our Main Objective for this assignment, is to design an Interactive Website that shows and informs our users about the dangers and risks of the Covid-19 Virus and also together with the ways which they can do to protect themselves from this deadly and pesky virus. People will also be able to receive the most up-to-date information on the confirmed cases from around the world daily, whereby they can compare the amount of cases from their desired choice of any date and time to another. Lastly, they can also learn and gain new knowledge on what kind of symptoms they might have if they do suspect that they've been infected with the Covid-19 Virus, as well as what precautions and what steps to take right away to prevent the infection from spreading.

While we were brainstorming ideas for our website, we tried to look from the perspective of the users who are using our website. such as:

**User Stories**
- As a user, I would want to know about the main purpose of what this website is mainly for.
- As a user, I would like to briefly learn the common symptoms of Covid-19.
