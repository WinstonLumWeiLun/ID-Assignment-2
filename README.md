_____________

We chose Covid-19 as our project theme to show how serious the Covid-19 is. Many people do not care how about dangerous it was after everyone took the booster shot. However, the number of cases relating to the Covid-19's infections and deaths continues to rise. As a result, our first aim is to inform and show people about the dangers and risk of the Covid-19 Virus and together with the ways that they can do to protect themselves from this deadly virus.
