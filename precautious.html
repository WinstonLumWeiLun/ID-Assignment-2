                <div class="infomation">
                    <h3>Wash Your Hand</h3>
                    <p>Hands should be washed with soap to eradicate germs.
                       Because people routinely touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without realizing it, this helps to avoid infections.
                       Handwashing, by removing germs, helps to prevent diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, as well as skin and eye problems. </p>

                <div class="infomation">
                    <h3>Always Wear a Mask</h3>
                    <p>When talking, breathing, or coughing, face coverings reduce the volume and travel distance of exhaled droplets. 
                       A face mask with no vents or holes will filter out virus-carrying particles from inhaled and exhaled air, 
                       lowering the risk of infection. </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Stay Home During Fever</h3>
                    <p>According to a recent research, a sick employee may transfer their germs to up to 60% of routinely touched surfaces in the workplace in just four hours, 
                       significantly raising the risk of disease spreading to coworkers.
                       Your disease might be transferred by close talking, sneezing, or coughing, even if you didn't touch anything at work, which is very impossible. </p>

                    <h3>Avoid Close Contact With Animals</h3>
                    <p>During close contact, the virus can spread from people to animals.
                       More study is needed to find whether and how COVID-19 affects different animals.
                       People who have COVID-19, whether suspected or proven, should stay away from animals, including pets, livestock, and wildlife.</p>

                    <p>The coronavirus is mostly transmitted from one person to another.
                       A person who has been infected with the coronavirus, even though they have no symptoms.</p>

                    <h3>Avoid Crowded Area</h3>
                    <p>COVID-19 spreading is limited by physical distancing, 
                       which involves keeping a space of at least 1 meter between each other and avoiding spending time in crowded locations or in groups.
